#AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
#Explanation
#Variables: We define the total orders processed, total employees, total hours worked, and the expected orders per hour.
#Calculations:
#Orders per Employee: Total orders divided by the number of employees.
#Actual Orders per Hour per Employee: Orders per employee divided by total hours worked.
#Comparison: We compare the actual orders per hour per employee with the expected orders per hour and print the result.
#You can modify the values of the variables to match different scenarios in the logistics industry. This script will help you understand how to calculate and compare the performance of employees based on the number of orders processed.
